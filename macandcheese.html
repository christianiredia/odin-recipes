<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Looking for a quick and delicious meal? Look no further!</p>
<p>Here is some creamy, and dreamy, comfort food that gets baked to cheesy, bubbly perfection in the oven.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>

<li>Elbow macaroni: It`s my favorite for this recipe, but any other bite-sized pasta will work.</li>
<li>Butter: salted or unsalted will work just adjust the amount of salt you add, depending on the butter.</li>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Ground black pepper</li>
<li>Milk</li>
<li>Half and half</li>
<li>Shredded Cheddar cheese: the higher quality aged-cheddar, the better!</li>

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>

    <li>Preheat the oven. Preheat to 325 degrees and lightly grease a square baking dish.</li>
        <li>Cook the macaroni. Slightly undercook your noodles (about 1 minute under al-dente). Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Make the roux.  Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add milk and cheese.  Stir in milk and half and half, slowly, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. 
                    Add 1 cup shredded cheese to the sauce and stir just until melted. Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat them in the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Pour into baking dish.  Pour half or the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Â½ cup cheese over the top. 
                        Pour remaining pasta over it and sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>

</ol>
